## Automated @eeacms dependencies upgrades

All the addon dependencies that are located in the dependencies section of `package.json` file that belong to @eeacms and have a `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` version are automatically upgraded on the release of a new version of the addon. This upgrade is done directly on the `develop` branch.

Exceptions from automated upgrades ( see https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/package-json#dependencies for dependency configuration examples ) :
* All github or local paths
* Any version intervals ( `^version` or `>version` or `MAJOR.MINOR.x` etc )

## Release

See [release](https://github.com/eea/ims-frontend/tree/master/RELEASE.md)

## Production

We use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Rancher](https://rancher.com/) and [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) to deploy this application in production.

### Deploy

* Within `Rancher > Catalog > EEA`

### Upgrade

* Within your Rancher environment click on the `Upgrade available` yellow button next to your stack.

TEST

* Confirm the upgrade

* Or roll-back if something went wrong and abort the upgrade procedure.
